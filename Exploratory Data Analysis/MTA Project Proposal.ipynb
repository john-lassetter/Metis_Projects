Therefore, this will not be a part of the first draft of the analysis."

    "Dataset:  I only plan to use the MTA turnstile data at this point in time which I will download and access using SQLAlchemy. An individual unit of this data is a cumulative total of entries and exits at a turnstile over a time period, typically 4 hours. Therefore, the unit of analysis will be a number of people crossing a turnstile (in either direction) in a time period. I expect to use the number of entries and exits as well as the location of the turnstiles (station, linename, etc.) and time of audit. My model's target will ideally be unique foot traffic defined as the number of individuals passing through a street team location (probably a station?) who have not yet passed through a previous street team location. For the first iteration, the target might instead be foot traffic without the unique qualifier."
