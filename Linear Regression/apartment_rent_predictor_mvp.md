### Preliminary Results
I have scraped 200 apartments so far from apartments.com and found the above relationships between square feet and monthly rent. Going forward I plan to include
build date, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, distance to nearby airports and schools, and common ammenities like A/C and whether or not pets are allowed
