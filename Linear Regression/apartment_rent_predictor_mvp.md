# Apartment Rent Predictor

### Question
How much will an apartment rent for based on its square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc?

### Preliminary Results
I have scraped 8000 apartments so far from apartments.com and found this positive correlation between square feet and monthly rent. Going forward I plan to include
build date, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, distance to nearby airports and schools, and common ammenities like A/C and whether or not pets are allowed.
